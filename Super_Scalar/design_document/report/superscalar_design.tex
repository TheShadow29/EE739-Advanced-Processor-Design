\subsection{Register Renaming}
Registers are 16-bit.
Carry and Zero Flag registers are 1-bit.
\subsubsection{Architectural Register File}
\begin{itemize}
\item They store tags of the corresponding rename regiser for every Architectural registers, along with non-speculative data.
\item It will also have a valid bit. Whenver interrupt all valid bits are set to 1.
\item If the AR is renamed, then it is invalid, else it is valid.
\item It is set valid, only when the tag pointed by it, and the tag broadcasted by the ROB matches.
\item It will take into account the interdependency bits and use the RRF queue to decide which tags to issue.

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Rename Register File}
\begin{itemize}
\item Execution will give the tag for the RR, and the corresponding register will update its value.
\item This will also be broadcasted RS.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{RRF Queue}
\begin{itemize}
\item Queue of available rename registers, updated based on ROB tag broadcast.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Reservation Station}
\subsubsection{Allocation Policy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Keep a queue (circular), to store the available RS entries for allocation.
\item This has to check whether or not to stall.
\item The register values are from the pipeline registers, valid bits from the ARF, and ROB tag from ROB.
\item It also allocates to the ROB, and checks for stalls.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Issue Policy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Top-down search for ready bits.
\item Decides between alu, branch, memory, as well as memory branch Execution pipes.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Table}
\begin{itemize}
\item Source Rename Register Tags.
\item Immediate Data
\item 
\item ROB tag.
